### Description
INS Hub is a web application built for Insurance agents to manage their client's database with built-in email reminder function for their expiring policies.

### User Story
The insurance industry is very service oriented and extremely competitive in Singapore. 
Most of the Insurance Agents that handle general insurance policies (e.g: Car/Travel/Home etc.) 
do not maintain a proper system to keep themselves updated of their client's policy renewal dates.
Due to their busy schedules, they tend to miss out on updating their clients and result in loss of business and client's trust.

### Solution
Develop a robust web application for client database management with a reminder function that send scheduled email reminders to
the respective Agents when their client policy is almost due.

### Actual Product
